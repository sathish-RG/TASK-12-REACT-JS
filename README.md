# Password Reset Flow

This document outlines the password reset flow for our application.

## Steps

1. **Request Password Reset**
  - User clicks on the "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
  - User is prompted to enter their registered email address.
  - User submits the email address.

2. **Send Reset Email**
  - The system generates a unique password reset token.
  - The system sends an email to the user with a password reset link containing the token.

3. **Reset Password**
  - User clicks on the password reset link in the email.
  - User is redirected to a password reset page.
  - User enters a new password and confirms it.
  - User submits the new password.

4. **Update Password**
  - The system validates the token and the new password.
  - If valid, the system updates the user's password in the database.
  - User is notified that the password has been successfully reset.

## Security Considerations

- The password reset token should be time-limited (e.g., expire after 1 hour).
- The token should be securely generated and stored.
- The new password should meet the application's password complexity requirements.

## Error Handling

- If the email address is not registered, the system should not disclose this information to the user.
- If the token is invalid or expired, the user should be prompted to request a new password reset.

## Dependencies

- Email service for sending password reset emails.
- Secure storage for password reset tokens.

## Testing

- Verify that the password reset email is sent correctly.
- Verify that the password reset link works and allows the user to reset their password.
- Verify that the new password is updated in the database.
- Verify that expired or invalid tokens are handled correctly.
